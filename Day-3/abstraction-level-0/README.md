# Abstraction Level 0 – Basic Script (No Abstraction)

This folder contains a **basic Python script** for line-by-line text processing, as the starting point of the abstraction challenge.

---

## Script: `process.py`

- Reads lines from standard input (`stdin`)
- Strips leading/trailing whitespace
- Converts each line to **uppercase**
- Prints the processed lines to standard output (`stdout`)

---

## Folder Structure 
```
abstraction-level-0/
├── process.py         # the Python script
└── README.md          # explains this level
```


## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.

From inside this folder, run:

```
python process.py 
```

Then type some lines, for example:

``` 
 hello world
this is a test
```

## What It Does
1. [x] Reads the input line by line from stdin.
2. [x] Strips whitespace and converts to uppercase.
3. [x] Prints the processed lines to the terminal.
